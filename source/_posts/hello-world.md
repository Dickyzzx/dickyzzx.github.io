你好！！！

虽然我不知道你是怎么来到这个网站的，但是欢迎你的到来，这是我的个人网站，在这里主要分享我的一些学习内容或正在进行的项目以及一些日常吧，我目前是约翰霍金斯怀挺工程学院的研究生，专业是数据科学，我本科就读于亚利桑那州立大学，专业是计算机科学和商业数据分析。如果你有阅读我笔记可能会觉得我做的很简陋以及杂乱，因为我主要是根据我个人的科技树去做的记录，方便我日后复习，但是如果遇到好的资源我都会贴上，那些资源会比我做的要好很多，是十分值得观看的

Hello!!!

Welcome to my personal website! I'm glad you found your way here. This site is where I share my learning experiences, current projects, and some aspects of my daily life.

I am currently a graduate student at Johns Hopkins University's Whiting School of Engineering, specializing in Data Science. I completed my undergraduate degree at Arizona State University, majoring in Computer Science and Business Data Analytics.

You might find my notes a bit basic and disorganized since they're primarily for my personal reference, organized according to my own learning path. However, I always include high-quality resources whenever I find them. These resources are much more comprehensive and are highly recommended for further reading.
